Iceman.Finance is a yield Optimizer with the highest rewards and perpetual buybacks on BSC, FTM, and MATIC offering yield aggregation for holders and users of ICEMAN tokens.To facilitate automation of the yield farming and the process of compounding, Iceman.finance uses vaults. Vaults also enable a more efficient utilization of gas, as well as other automated processes, and use different yield strategies to help users grow their assets through automation.

Iceman.finance has an optimal compounding strategy with an efficient pricing model, designed to encourage long-term yield farming and provide appropriate incentives for long-term holders. Thanks to the automation factor in the process of yield generation and compounding, users don't need to manually reinvest their staking rewards, but can rely on automated asset growth by simply making a deposit into a non native Iceman.finance farm or pool.

ICEMAN holders also don’t need to have extensive knowledge of the underlying protocols that support automation and yield optimization, while depositing funds to vaults represents a passive investment strategy. The goal is to increase the initial value of assets deposited by users, similar to how crypto hedge funds work, with minimal involvement on users’ end.
